## Overview

The Factify API is a RESTful API that allows you to create, manage, and control access to legally-binding documents. Our API follows modern best practices inspired by leading platforms like Stripe.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.factify.com/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fac_live_sk_..."
```

API keys are environment-specific:
- `fac_test_sk_...` - Test environment keys
- `fac_live_sk_...` - Production environment keys

<Warning>
Never expose your secret keys in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Resource Identifiers (TypeID)

All resource identifiers in the Factify API use [TypeID](https://github.com/jetify-com/typeid) format - a type-safe, K-sortable, globally unique identifier.

### Format

```
{prefix}_{base32-encoded-uuidv7}
```

| Resource | Prefix | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Document | `doc_` | `doc_01h2xcejqtf2nbrexx3vqjhp41` |
| Version | `ver_` | `ver_01h2xcejqtf2nbrexx3vqjhp45` |
| Policy | `pol_` | `pol_01h2xcej8mf2nbrexx3vqjhp42` |
| User | `user_` | `user_01h2xcejqtf2nbrexx3vqjhp44` |

### Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Type Safety">
    The prefix immediately tells you what type of resource an ID refers to. You can't accidentally use a document ID where a version ID is expected:
    ```typescript
    // TypeScript can enforce this at compile time
    type DocumentId = `doc_${string}`;
    type VersionId = `ver_${string}`;
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time-Sortable">
    TypeIDs are based on UUIDv7, which includes a timestamp component. This means IDs are naturally ordered by creation time, enabling efficient database indexing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Debug-Friendly">
    When you see an ID in logs or error messages, you immediately know what resource type it refers to:
    ```
    // Clear from the ID what went wrong
    Error: Failed to fetch doc_01h2xcej... from versions table
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="URL-Safe">
    TypeIDs use a base32 alphabet that excludes ambiguous characters (i, l, o, u). They're safe for URLs without encoding and can be selected by double-clicking.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Validation Pattern

If you need to validate TypeID format, use this regex pattern:

```regex
^{prefix}_[0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-z]{26}$
```

For example, to validate a document ID:
```regex
^doc_[0-9a-hjkmnp-tv-z]{26}$
```

## Pagination

List endpoints use cursor-based pagination for efficient, consistent results:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [...],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6..."
}
```

Use the `cursor` parameter to fetch the next page:

```bash
curl "https://api.factify.com/v1/documents?cursor=eyJpZCI6..."
```

## Error Handling

Errors follow a consistent structure with machine-readable codes:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "The access_level field must be one of: private, organization, public",
    "code": "invalid_enum_value",
    "param": "access_level"
  }
}
```

See the [API Reference](/api-reference) for detailed error codes per endpoint.

## Idempotency

For safe retries on mutating operations, include an `Idempotency-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.factify.com/v1/documents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer fac_live_sk_..." \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Q4 Report"}'
```

Requests with the same idempotency key within 24 hours return the cached response.
